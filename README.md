Dataset Generation for Federated Learning with MEDMNIST
This repository provides tools for generating federated learning datasets, specifically using the MEDMNIST collection. It supports various partitioning strategies and configurations to facilitate experiments with different data distribution scenarios.

Overview
The dataset generation scripts are designed to create federated datasets with the MEDMNIST collection, which includes medical imaging datasets such as PathMNIST, ChestMNIST, and more. The generated datasets are suitable for training and evaluating federated learning algorithms under various conditions, including IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and non-IID (non-Identically Distributed) scenarios.

Key Features
MEDMNIST Datasets: Includes support for the following datasets:

PathMNIST
ChestMNIST
DermaMNIST
OCTMNIST
PneumoniaMNIST
RetinaMNIST
BreastMNIST
BloodMNIST
TissueMNIST
OrganAMNIST
OrganCMNIST
OrganSMNIST
Flexible Data Partitioning: Generate datasets with various partition strategies:

IID: Independent and identically distributed data.
non-IID: Non-identically distributed data with customizable partition methods.
Custom Partitioning: Specify your own partitioning strategy.
Balancing Options: Choose between balanced and unbalanced data distributions to match different experimental requirements.

Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters such as the number of clients, data distribution type, and partition method.




<dataset_name>: The name of the MEDMNIST dataset (e.g., tissuemnist).
<num_clients>: Number of federated clients.
<noniid|iid>: Type of data distribution.
<balance|unbalance>: Whether the data should be balanced or unbalanced.
<partition_method>: Partitioning strategy (e.g., pat, dir, or exdir).
